# Refactor Context Documentation to OpenSpec Specifications

## Why

The project currently has comprehensive documentation in various markdown files (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STORIES_FEATURE.md, etc.) but lacks formal OpenSpec specifications. This makes it difficult for AI assistants to understand the exact requirements and behavior of the system when making changes.

Converting existing context documentation into proper OpenSpec specs will:
- Provide clear, testable requirements with scenarios
- Enable AI assistants to make more informed decisions
- Create a single source of truth for system behavior
- Support future development with spec-driven workflow
- Make it easier to validate changes against requirements

## What Changes

- **NEW**: Create formal OpenSpec specifications for three main capabilities:
  1. **auth**: User authentication and authorization (Laravel Sanctum)
  2. **weather**: Weather data fetching, processing, and analysis
  3. **stories**: Weather-related news stories management

- Extract requirements from existing documentation
- Define clear scenarios for each requirement using WHEN/THEN format
- Document API endpoints with request/response formats
- Include database schema definitions
- Add technical constraints and patterns

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: auth/, weather/, stories/ (all new)
- **Affected code**: None (documentation only)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Better AI assistant context for future changes
  - Clear acceptance criteria for features
  - Easier onboarding for new developers
  - Foundation for test case generation
- **Breaking changes**: None

## Migration Path

1. Create spec structure under `openspec/specs/`
2. Extract requirements from existing docs
3. Format as OpenSpec requirements with scenarios
4. Validate all specs with `openspec validate --strict`
5. Archive this change
6. Use specs as source of truth going forward
